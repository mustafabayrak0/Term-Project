# Term-Project </br>
This is a basic quiz application.Letters or numbers are used to choose between options in the app. </br>
I have two csv files with user information(usernames.csv) and questions(questions.csv). </br>
I used the matplotlib library. </br>
You must answer questions with capital letters. </br>
Comma and empty usernames are not allowed in registration. </br>
I wrote(rank,username,best score, best time of best score) in usernames.csv. </br>
I wrote(number of quesiton,question,correct answer,choices,how many times that question answered correctly,how many times that question has been asked) in questions.csv. </br>
There is no time limit in the quiz but the fastest one wins.
