# Term-Project
This is a basic quiz application.Letters or numbers are used to choose between options in the app.
I have two csv files with user information(usernames.csv) and questions(questions.csv)
i used the matplotlib library
You must answer questions with capital letters.
Comma and empty usernames are not allowed in registration
In usernames.csv I wrote(rank,username,best score, best time of best score)
In questions.csv I wrote(number of quesiton,question,correct answer,choices, how many times that question answered correctly, how many times that question has been asked)
There is no time limit in the quiz but the fastest one wins.
